# BlankPySide6NGL / using_mixin

These demos are a starting point for creating a PySide6 application with NGL support.

It has a basic full screen OpenGL window and simple mouse and keyboard controls.

The BlankPySide6NGL demo has all of the mouse / keyboard controls implemented in the file, whilst the using_mixin version imports the controls from ncca.ngl instead as it is a more modular approach and this code is repeated a lot in my demos.
