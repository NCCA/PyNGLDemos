# BoidShaded

This demo shows how to create a simple Boid shaped VertexArrayObject using just vertices. It uses the SimpleVAO factory to create the VertexArrayObject from a list of vertices stored in the Vec3Array class.

Normals are calculated using the Utils.calculate_normal function.

This demos uses one buffer packed Vertices[] -> Normnals[] and shows how to set the buffer offsets for correct rendering.
