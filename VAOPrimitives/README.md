# VAOPrimitives Examples

This demo shows how to use the build in primitives for NGL.

The primitives are split into two categories:

1. Mesh primitives such as the teapot, bunny buddah, dragon and troll
2. Procedural primitives such as the sphere, cube, cylinder, cone, and pyramid

The procedural primitives need to be build using the create methods as shown in the code.
