# PBRTexture


This demo shows how to render using Physically Based Rendering (PBR) techniques as outlined in https://learnopengl.com/PBR/Lighting

In particular this demo uses a class called texture_pack which can read in a json file containing a list of textures and locations for easy texture management.
