# Blit

This demo shows how to use the glBlitFramebuffer function to copy a framebuffer to another framebuffer. In this demo a shader is run to generate different check pattern in the framebuffer.

Each colour attachment is a different check pattern and the user can then choose which one to display.

It also shows how to create a screen quad for rendering the framebuffer to the screen.
